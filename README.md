### Tools and Software

- **PVMatts Calculator**: Used for estimating the performance of PV systems.
- **PVSYST**: Software for designing and simulating PV systems, evident in TASK6pvsyst.pdf.
- **PowerWorld**: Mentioned for potential grid integration studies, though not directly used here.

## Solar Radiation Analysis

Solar radiation data is crucial for estimating energy production. The radiation varies monthly and annually, influencing the system's performance. For instance, New Delhi receives higher radiation in March and April, while Kanpur shows similar patterns but with slight variations.

## System Design Considerations

- **Array Type**: Projects use 2-axis tracking or fixed mounting, affecting energy capture efficiency.
- **Tilt and Azimuth**: Set based on latitude and longitude for optimal sun exposure.
- **System Losses**: Include shading, soiling, and wiring losses, typically around 14.08%.

## Economic Analysis

The economic value is calculated based on the average retail electricity rate of $0.0385/kWh. The capacity factor, indicating system efficiency, ranges from 16.2% to 20.9%, showing the systems' effectiveness in energy production.

## Data Collection and Methodology

Data was collected using historical meteorological data input into the PVMatts Calculator and PVSYST. The analyses assume standard system losses and inverter efficiencies, which can influence the results.

## Insights and Patterns

- **Location Impact**: Systems in sunnier locations like Indore produce more energy.
- **System Scalability**: Larger systems in Delhi and Indore show higher energy production and economic value.
- **Design Choices**: 2-axis tracking improves energy capture compared to fixed systems.

## Conclusion

These analyses provide valuable insights into the feasibility and performance of solar PV systems in different Indian locations. They highlight the importance of system design, location, and solar radiation in determining energy production and economic viability. These findings can inform future solar installations and energy planning strategies.
